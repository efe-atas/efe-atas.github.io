Hello! I'm İsmail Efe Ataş. I am studying Computer Engineering at TED University with a full scholarship while also pursuing a minor in Business Administration. I am a passionate software engineer interested in artificial intelligence, computer vision, and mobile application development.

Currently, I am working as a research assistant under the TÜBİTAK 2247-C Undergraduate Research Program. In this role, I develop React-based web applications for real-time monitoring of animal behavior and work on YOLO-based object detection models. Additionally, I am gaining experience in training and optimization of Large Language Models (LLMs).

At Wellztech Information Technologies, I worked on AI-powered animal behavior analysis systems. I developed a DICOM viewer and performed video analysis using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN). During my internship at Limak Technology, I gained experience in mobile application development using Flutter and developed a facial recognition application with OpenAI API integration.

My projects include a course scheduling system for my university, a deep learning-based cat-dog classification model, and image processing algorithms. I closely follow technological developments and continuously strive to improve myself.

I have experience in programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, C, and Dart. I actively use artificial intelligence libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV. I'm always excited to learn new technologies and use them to solve real-world problems.

To get in touch or learn more about my projects, you can visit my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/efeatas) or [GitHub](https://github.com/efe-atas) profiles.
