Hello! I'm İsmail Efe Ataş. I am studying Computer Engineering. I really like this technology. The tabs in my mind could seem sophisticated but i always pursue to what i want. btw f*ck ai. i like developing ai but not for using. i was heavy prompter but i decided to do not use ai. sorry for my broke english but at least it is not ai generated. best way the chop fast is chop slow. 

I am planning to tell my story and show the thing that i created.

To get in touch or learn more about my projects, you can visit my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/efeatas) or [GitHub](https://github.com/efe-atas) profiles.
